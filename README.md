## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict taxi fares in New York City using historical ride data. By analyzing factors such as trip distance, pickup/dropoff time, and passenger count, a regression model is trained to estimate the fare amount.
This can help ride-sharing platforms offer fare estimates to users in real-time and detect anomalies or fraud.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **NYC Taxi Fare Prediction** dataset from Kaggle:

* [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction)
* It contains information such as:
  * `pickup_datetime`
  * `pickup_longitude`, `pickup_latitude`
  * `dropoff_longitude`, `dropoff_latitude`
  * `passenger_count`
  * `fare_amount` (target variable)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
* Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
* Scikit-learn (modeling)
* XGBoost / LightGBM (advanced models)
* Geopy (for distance calculation)

## 🧑‍💻 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cab-fare-prediction.git
cd cab-fare-prediction

2. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 📈 Usage

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. Run the notebook or script:
jupyter notebook cab_fare_prediction.ipynb

3. The script will:

   * Clean the dataset
   * Perform feature engineering (e.g., calculate distance, extract datetime components)
   * Train a regression model
   * Evaluate performance using RMSE

## ✅ Model Performance

* Best RMSE (XGBoost Model): \~2.1
* Models tested: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM

## 🚧 Future Improvements

* Deploy the model as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI
* Add real-time fare prediction using a web interface
* Include weather and traffic data to improve accuracy
* Use map-based visualizations for routes
